                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>
                  Magnesium is the 4th most abundant mineral in the body and low
                  levels can drastically impact your overall health. Thatâ€™s why
                  we created a concentrated Magnesium cream that has incredible
                  uses. Here are a few:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Rub onto sore muscles</li>
                  <li>Massage onto temples & neck to ease head tension</li>
                  <li>
                    Use on bottom of feet before bed to promote restful sleep
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Massage onto chest & shoulders to alleviate anxious feelings
                  </li>
                  <li>Rub onto legs to soothe muscle spasms</li>
                  <li>Apply to inflamed joints and tendons</li>

                  Which is why our customers rave about our powerfully effective
                  Magnesium infused body cream! Combining both science and
                  nature to guide our formulations, magnesium chloride is
                  delicately infused into organic mango butter, organic shea
                  butter and organic coconut oil and blended into a perfectly
                  whipped cream that is gentle, moisturizing smooth and
                  effective.

                  GMO-free, gluten-free and made with organic ingredients. This

                  of magnesium directly to the cells while nourishing skin.
                  Massage desired amount into the skin thoroughly. Repeat as
                  necessary to treat ailments, covering any areas needing extra
                  attention. Store in a cool, dry place. Do not apply to cuts,
                  wounds, open sores or freshly shaved areas of skin, and always
                  test a small amount on a patch of skin first to ensure you are
                  not allergic to any ingredient in our products.
